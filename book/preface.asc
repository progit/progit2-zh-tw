Scott Chacon 的前言
Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git.
歡迎來到 Pro Git 的第二版
The first edition was published over four years ago now.
第一版已經發行至今超過4年了
Since then a lot has changed and yet many important things have not.
自那時以來有很多東西已經改變但很多重要的東西卻沒有
While most of the core commands and concepts are still valid today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping things backward compatible, there have been some significant additions and changes in the community surrounding Git.
大多數核心命令和概念至今仍然有效因為 Git 核心團隊在向前個版本兼容的程度很讓人吃驚，但還有一些重大的增加和變化在 Git 的相關社群
The second edition of this book is meant to address those changes and update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.
這本書的第二版是為了定位那些改變和更新第一版，如此這本書對於現今使用者才能更加的有幫助
When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively difficult to use and barely adopted tool for the harder core hacker.
當我寫第一版時，Git 是個相對困難去使用和僅適合 harder core 使用者的工具
It was starting to gain steam in certain communities, but had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity it has today.
它在當時的社群中使用率開始蒸蒸日上，但尚未到達像今天如此的無所不在
Since then, nearly every open source community has adopted it.
自那時起，將近所有開源社群都已經採用它
Git has made incredible progress on Windows, in the explosion of graphical user interfaces to it for all platforms, in IDE support and in business use.
Git 在 Windows 上已經有了難以置信的進展，對於所有平台，圖形用戶介面上有了爆炸性的增加，支援 IDE 和在商業中使用
The Pro Git of four years ago knows about none of that.
四年前的 Pro Git 還無法預知到這些事
One of the main aims of this new edition is to touch on all of those new frontiers in the Git community.
這個新版本主要的目標之一是要觸動所有在 Git 社群中的那些新前沿

The Open Source community using Git has also exploded.
使用 Git 的開源社群也已經激增
When I originally sat down to write the book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the first version out), I had just started working at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub.
當我五年前坐下來寫這本書時(我花了一些時間做出它)，我就已經開始在一家小有名氣發展網頁板的 Git 託管服務叫做 GitHub 的公司
At the time of publishing there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us working on it.
在發佈時，大概只有幾千人在使用這網站並只有我們 4 人在上面工作
As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10 millionth hosted project, with nearly 5 million registered developer accounts and over 230 employees.
在我寫這個介紹文時，GitHub 已經有第一千萬個被託管的專案，還有近 500 萬個註冊開發者帳戶和 230 個員工
Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when I sat down to write the first edition.
愛它或是討厭它，當我坐下來寫第一版時，GitHub 已經重大的改變了很大片的開源社群，這是難以置信的
I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git which I was never very comfortable with.
我在 Pro Git 的原始版本中寫了一小部分關於 GitHub ，一個我不是很喜歡的被託管 Git 的例子
I didn't much like that I was writing what I felt was essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it.
我不是很喜歡我寫的感受被當成本質上的社群資源和在書中談到我的公司
While I still don't love that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable.
雖然我仍然不喜愛這個和興趣產生的衝突，但在 Git 社群中 GitHub 的重要性是無法避免的
Instead of an example of Git hosting, I have decided to turn that part of the book into more deeply describing what GitHub is and how to effectively use it.
除了這個 Git 託管服務的例子，我已經決定把書的那部分變成更深度的描述何謂 GitHub 和如何有效的使用它
If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which Git host you decide to use for your own code.
如果你要學習如何使用 Git，那麼知道如何使用 GitHub 將會幫助你參與一個龐大的社群，無論你要把你的程式碼用在哪個 Git 主機都是有價值的
The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions. Most of the examples in the book have been changed to HTTP from SSH because it's so much simpler.
自從上次最新的公布以來，其他大的改變就是 HTTP 對於 Git 網路交易協定的發展和興起。在書中最多的例子就是已經從 SSH 改成 HTTP 因為他是如此簡單
It's been amazing to watch Git grow over the past few years from a relatively obscure version control system to basically dominating commercial and open source version control. I'm happy that Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market that is both quite successful and fully open source.
看到 Git 近年來的發展，從一個相對模糊的版本控制系統到一個基礎地支配商業和開放原始碼的版本控制是令人驚奇的。我很開心於 Pro Git 已經完成的這麼好和已經能成為少數之一在市場上的技術書籍能同時發展的如此成功和開放來源
I hope you enjoy this updated edition of Pro Git.
我希望你能享受這個更新版本的 Pro Git

Ben Straub 的前言

The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git. This was my introduction to a style of making software that felt more natural than anything I had seen before. I had been a developer for several years by then, but this was the right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path than the one I was on.
這本書的第一版就讓我迷上了 Git，這是我對一個風格的介紹，它讓軟體感覺比我之前看過的任何東西還要自然。我已經作為一個開發者數年，但這讓我踏入一條嶄新的路比我從前走過的有趣得多了。

Now, years later, I'm a contributor to a major Git implementation, I've worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I've traveled the world teaching people about Git. When Scott asked if I'd be interested in working on the second edition, I didn't even have to think.
經過幾年後的現在，我是一個重大 Git 實行的貢獻者，我已經在最大的 Git 託管服務公司工作，然後我旅行世界去教導人們 Git。當 Scott 尋問我是否對於開發第二版有興趣時，我甚至不需要思考。
It's been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book. I hope it helps you as much as it did me.
為這本書工作是非常高興和榮幸的。我希望它能幫助你很多，就像它幫助我的一樣。
